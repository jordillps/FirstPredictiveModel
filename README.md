### Mahine Learning First Predictive model with python
Machine learning (ML) is a powerful subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This jupyter notebook file shows the process of building a robust machine learning model using Python.

Steps:

* Define a problem.
* Collect and preprocess data.
* Engineer and select features.
* Build, train, and evaluate a model.
* Make predictions.
* Deploy your model using Flask.
* Explore advanced techniques such as model explainability, hyperparameter tuning, and automated retraining.
